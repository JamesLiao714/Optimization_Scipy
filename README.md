# Numerical Optimization
## Introduction
In this assignment, we expect you to be familiar with optimization library, the numerical calculation package 'SciPy'. We are using the Rosenbrock function as the benchmark of our optimization algorithms. Rosenbrock is a simple fourth-order function has the minimal point at [1,1]. We provide a visualization function which draws the contour.
